## Overview
- Guest Language(s)?
	- Still thinking whether I should do it this month (not mentally prepared to make a program with COBOL)
	- If I'll do it this month, I'll either do 4 languages (COBOL, Haskell, PL/I, Smalltalk) or write a program based on a broad topic (I don't know what other topics I can do that is related to finance aside from cryptos...)
- Ruby: Tool for Forex, Stocks, etc. (Basically an Alpha Vantage client)
	- Week 1 (1-7): Forex Client
	- Week 2 (8-14): Stocks Client
	- Week 3 (15-21): TBD
	- Week 4 (22-31): Combine the 3 programs into a single program
- Rust: Bank
	- Week 1: Login System
	- Week 2: ATM
	- Week 3: TBD
	- Week 4: Combine all 3 into one (might be a web app if I have time)
